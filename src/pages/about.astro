            More about me
          </h2>

          <div
            class="w-[75px] h-[5px] mt-1 rounded-full"

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I was born and raised in Singapore and now study Robotics Engineering
            at Arizona State University in the United States. I’ve always been the kid who wanted to know
            how things work – I grew up building and rebuilding LEGO sets, and
            that habit of taking things apart and making them better never
            really stopped. Today, that shows up as a strong interest in
            robotics, manufacturing, and process optimization.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            If I had to describe myself in one line, it would be:
            <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">
              I’m an ambitious, practical problem-solver who likes to optimize everything I touch.
            </span>
            Whether it’s a production flow, a 3D print, or a simple recipe,
            I’m the type of person who will run it over and over, tweaking one
            variable at a time, and documenting what works.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            One thing I’m always working on is consistency. I perform best in
            that sweet spot where there’s enough pressure to sharpen me, but not
            so much that it burns me out. I treat myself the same way I treat a
            system: I tune inputs, test, and improve. That mindset is what I
            bring to teams: I own problems, iterate on solutions, and
            steadily raise the bar without drama.

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I am a citizen of Singapore. For long-term employment in the United
            States, I am eligible for the
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">H-1B1: Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Professional</span>
            category, which was created specifically for professionals from
            Singapore (and Chile) working in specialty occupations such as
            engineering.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            The H-1B1 route is designed to be
            <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">simpler and lower-risk for employers</span>
            than the standard H-1B: it uses a separate quota reserved for
            Singapore, is not part of the main H-1B lottery, and can often be
            processed more quickly when the applicant is outside the U.S.
            Employers still file a standard Labor Condition Application (LCA)
            and pay the required prevailing wage, but there is no extra “lottery
            uncertainty” layer on top.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Recent regulatory changes added a large supplemental fee to some new
            H-1B petitions. That
            <span class="font-bold text-blue-400">
              supplemental fee does not apply to H-1B1 cases for Singaporean nationals
            </span>,
            which helps keep government filing costs more manageable on the
            employer side while still offering the same specialty-occupation
            standards and protections.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Practically speaking, this means I can be hired like any other
            full-time engineer, with a clear and well-defined immigration path
            that U.S. employers already understand. I’m happy to work with your
            legal/HR team to make the process as smooth as possible.

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Outside of work and school, I gravitate toward things that are
            physical, technical, or just a good test of focus. I’ve trained
            martial arts on and off since I was six, starting with Kali
            (Arnis) and later adding boxing, Muay Thai, kickboxing, and
            Jiu-Jitsu. I’m also a certified rescue diver with over 250 dives,
            which has given me a lot of respect for planning, risk management,
            and staying calm under pressure.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            On the more maker side, I enjoy 3D printing and hands-on
            projects, from custom parts to experimental hardware. I like cooking
            the same way I like engineering; running small experiments, tuning
            ratios, and chasing the “FINAL_FINAL_FINALFORREAL_Version12” that really feels right. I
            also enjoy DJing because it blends technical control, creativity, and
            performing under pressure. Long-term, I’m excited to keep blending
            these interests into a career where I’m designing, improving, and
            manufacturing real things into the world.
