          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I was born and raised in Singapore and now study Robotics Engineering
            in the United States. I’ve always been the kid who wanted to know
            how things work – I grew up building and rebuilding LEGO sets, and
            that habit of taking things apart and making them better never
            really stopped. Today, that shows up as a strong interest in
            robotics, manufacturing, and process optimization.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            If I had to describe myself in one line, it would be:
            <span class="font-semibold">
              I’m an ambitious, practical problem-solver who likes to optimize
              everything I touch.
            </span>
            Whether it’s a production flow, a 3D print, or a simple recipe,
            I’m the type of person who will run it ten times, tweak one
            variable at a time, and document what worked.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Moving to the U.S. pushed me out of a very sheltered comfort zone
            and forced me to build my own life from the ground up. I’m proud of
            the fact that I’ve carved out my own path here – not perfectly, and
            definitely not without mistakes – but with enough discipline and
            hard work that I can say I earned my place.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            One thing I’m always working on is consistency. I perform best in
            that sweet spot where there’s enough pressure to sharpen me, but not
            so much that it burns me out. I treat myself the same way I treat a
            system: I tune inputs, test, and improve. That mindset is what I
            bring to teams – I like to own problems, iterate on solutions, and
            steadily raise the bar without drama.

            I am a citizen of Singapore. For long-term employment in the United
            States, I am eligible for the
            <span class="font-semibold">H-1B1: Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Professional</span>
            category, which was created specifically for professionals from
            Singapore (and Chile) working in specialty occupations such as
            engineering.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            The H-1B1 route is designed to be
            <span class="font-semibold">simpler and lower-risk for employers</span>
            than the standard H-1B:
            it uses a separate quota reserved for Singapore, is not part of the
            main H-1B lottery, and can often be processed more quickly when the
            applicant is outside the U.S. Employers still file a standard Labor
            Condition Application (LCA) and pay the required prevailing wage,
            but there is no extra “lottery uncertainty” layer on top.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Recent regulatory changes added a large supplemental fee to some
            new H-1B petitions. That
            <span class="font-semibold">
              supplemental fee does not apply to H-1B1 cases for Singaporean
              nationals
            </span>,
            which helps keep government filing costs more manageable on the
            employer side while still offering the same specialty-occupation
            standards and protections.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Practically speaking, this means I can be hired like any other
            full-time engineer, with a clear and well-defined immigration path
            that U.S. employers already understand. If needed, I’m happy to work
            with your legal/HR team to make the process as smooth as possible.

            Outside of work and school, I gravitate toward things that are
            physical, technical, or just a good test of focus. I’ve trained
            martial arts on and off since I was six – starting with Kali
            Majapahit and later adding boxing, Muay Thai, kickboxing, and
            Jiu-Jitsu. I’m also a certified rescue diver with over 250 dives,
            which has given me a lot of respect for planning, risk management,
            and staying calm under pressure.
          </p>

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            On the more “builder” side, I enjoy 3D printing and hands-on
            projects, from custom parts to experimental hardware. I like cooking
            the same way I like engineering – running small experiments, tuning
            ratios, and chasing the “version 10” that finally feels right. I
            also enjoy DJing, mostly because it combines technical control,
            creativity, and performing under pressure. Long-term, I’m excited to
            keep blending these interests into a career where I’m designing,
            improving, and shipping real things into the world.
