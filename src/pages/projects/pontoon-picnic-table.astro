            This started as a front desk daydream that turned into a summer
            project. I had some surplus income, a bit of free time, and the
            desire to build something ridiculous, fun, and just barely
            practical: a floating picnic table.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            The goal was simple: build a floating picnic table that could carry
            at least four people down the Salt River without sinking, capsizing,
            or blowing the budget.

              Create a floating picnic platform that can comfortably carry four

            The Pontoon Picnic Table is a DIY floating platform: a standard
            picnic table mounted on a 2x4 frame that's bolted to four
            55-gallon steel drums using custom welded steel brackets. The drums
            provide buoyancy, the timber frame provides structure, and the table
            turns it into usable space instead of just a raft.

            structure built into the frame. The drawing captured rough
            dimensions, barrel spacing, and how the brackets would tie the wood
            frame into the steel drums.

                thin-walled plastic, and could be directly welded to the custom

            </li>
            <li>
              Built the main rectangular frame from 2x4s, essentially a
              wooden square that would sit around the barrels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Positioned each barrel against the inner edges of the frame and
              added additional 2x4s to trap and locate them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut steel bar sections, bent them to the correct angle, and
              welded them to the barrels as custom brackets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drilled holes in the brackets and matching holes through the wood
              frame; bolted the frame to the brackets using nuts, bolts, and
              flat steel pieces as heavy-duty washers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built up the bench sections from 2x4s and scrap wood, then framed
              and decked the tabletop (including the original &quot;door
              table&quot; iteration).
            </li>
            <li>
              Applied a water-resistant coating to the wood (in hindsight, this
              should have been done earlier in the process).
            </li>
            <li>
              Made sure bolts were torqued tight and then sent it.

              down the Salt River from Water Users to Exit 4. It made the full
              run without capsizing or sinking. The barrels picked up a few
              dents from rocks, but there were no cracks or leaks and no
              structural failures.
