            This started as a summer side quest: turn a cheap river float into a full picnic experience.
            The real goal was not “float once.” The goal was to build something that could take abuse:
            shallow drags, rock strikes, rapid currents, and a fully loaded crew, while staying under $100
            and staying legal for transport in a pickup.

            A pontoon picnic table built from standard construction lumber and four 55-gallon drums, mounted using custom
            welded steel brackets. The structure was designed around weight distribution and stability first, then optimized
            around budget and transport constraints.

            The critical detail was the bracket system. The barrels were rigidly mounted using custom steel brackets that were
            welded directly to the drums, then fastened into the wood structure with long bolts.
