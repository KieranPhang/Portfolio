      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Overview</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        “Out To Lunch” is a low-cost pontoon picnic table designed and built as a
        functional watercraft for leisurely river floats. What started as a summer
        side quest quickly turned into a full stress test in real-world conditions:
        shallow water, rock strikes, rapid currents, transport constraints, and a
        fully loaded crew.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        The platform was intentionally pushed to its limits by floating it down the
        Salt River, Arizona, where it survived hours of use without tipping, breaking,
        or violating transport laws.

    <!-- ROLE -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">My Role</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I was the primary designer, fabricator, and tester. I handled the structural
        design, welding, material sourcing, and launch coordination. A friend, Logan,
        assisted with portions of the woodwork and assembly. Technical advisors were
        consulted informally, but the design and execution were largely my own.

    <!-- CONSTRAINTS -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Design Constraints</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Total budget under <strong>$100 USD</strong> (excluding gas)</li>
        <li>Buoyancy sufficient for <strong>4 people minimum</strong> (calculated up to 8)</li>
        <li>Structural stability under shallow water drag and rock strikes</li>
        <li>Pickup truck transport within Arizona overhang limits</li>
        <li>Large, usable table surface for food and drinks</li>
        <li>Minimum operational depth of ~1 ft with ~300 lbs of people + gear</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- MATERIALS -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Materials & Fabrication</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        The structure was built using standard construction lumber and salvaged
        materials wherever possible. Four 55-gallon steel drums provided buoyancy and
        were rigidly mounted using custom-fabricated steel brackets.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>2×4 lumber and assorted scrap wood (including a reclaimed door)</li>
        <li>4 × 55-gallon steel drums</li>
        <li>Custom steel brackets welded directly to the barrels</li>
        <li>Long through-bolts for structural fastening</li>
        <li>Wood sealant and caulk for water resistance</li>
        <li>Vinyl flooring applied to seating surfaces for comfort</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Lumber: ~$21</li>
        <li>Steel drums (4×): ~$32</li>
        <li>Hardware (bolts, fasteners): ~$20</li>
        <li>Sealant & caulk: ~$10</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Testing & Failure Modes</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        The platform was deliberately tested beyond normal use. Two people, each
        approximately 300 lbs combined per side, jumped on opposite benches in a
        seesaw-like motion to induce tipping. The structure did not tip.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Rock strikes in shallow sections</li>
        <li>Drag across low water depth</li>
        <li>Dynamic load shifting and jumping</li>
        <li>Lifting and loading into a pickup truck</li>
        <li>Extended float duration</li>

      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Backup inner tubes were carried in case of failure. Local river authorities
        were contacted prior to launch and confirmed the craft was acceptable as long
        as it remained unpowered. Personal flotation devices were available.
