          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">Why</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Starstitcher was proposed as a compact, reconfigurable manufacturing concept for space
            environments where resupply is expensive and mission needs evolve. The goal was a single
            system that could fabricate braided composite structures on demand, without being locked
            into one fixed geometry or one fixed motion track.

            <li><span class="font-medium">Primary goal:</span> a trackless braiding approach enabling flexible patterns and outcomes.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Constraints:</span> microgravity operation, launch packaging volume, limited power, material handling, repeatability.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Outcome focus:</span> communicate a credible systems concept with clear subsystem ownership and tradeoffs.</li>

        {/* WHAT */}
        <section class="space-y-4">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">What</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Starstitcher is a conceptual, trackless cable braiding system designed for space-ready
            manufacturing. It takes raw filament and forms braided structures in any form supported by
            an achievable braiding pattern and process setup, rather than limiting output to one or two
            hard-tooled geometries.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-100">Key requirements</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
            <li>Trackless carrier architecture to enable flexible braid patterns and reconfiguration.</li>
            <li>Launch-ready packaging and deployment into an operational configuration.</li>
            <li>Material handling compatible with microgravity constraints and limited crew time.</li>
            <li>Localized curing strategy compatible with constrained power and thermal environments.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="space-y-4">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">System Architecture &amp; Subsystems</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            At a high level, Starstitcher combines independent carriers, material handling, tension management,
            and localized curing to translate raw filament into braided composite structures. The defining idea
            is the trackless carrier concept, enabling patterns to be driven by system coordination and geometry
            rather than fixed tracks.
          </p>

              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-100">Carrier and braiding system</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Independent carriers transport filament spools through coordinated paths around the working area.
                By removing fixed tracks, the system can support a wide range of braid trajectories and densities,
                enabling reconfiguration without redesigning mechanical tooling.

              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-100">Take-up and tension control</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                The take-up arms manage tension and geometry as material is deposited, maintaining consistent braid
                formation and stabilizing the workpiece during fabrication.
              </p>

              <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                A loading mechanism supports spool staging and integration with carriers. This subsystem was designed
                to reduce intervention time and support launch packaging and deployment constraints.

              <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Integrated IR heating elements provide localized thermal input to support curing or consolidation of
                braided material, targeting a manufacturing flow that remains compatible with constrained power and
                thermal management in space environments.

              <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                The frame and subsystem arrangement were designed to compact for launch and then deploy to an operational
                configuration. This reduces overhead hardware and supports a practical space-ready concept.
